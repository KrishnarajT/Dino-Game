# This is a makefile to make statically link all the needed usual libraries of SFML into an exe on Windows. 
# This template can be used for compiling and linking single files that use SFML. 

# The usual system here is that there will be an include folder, and a lib folder. The include folder will have all the header files
# and the lib folder will have all the library files and the dll folder will have the dlls if needed. The library files will have yet 
# another SFML folder, that contains only the SFML libraries. This is because those libraries need that to be in their relative path to 
# be called as SFML/___.lib and the same goes with the header files for SFML. This makes it necessary to have a folder inside the include
# folder, but is also convenient, as you can put your own files inside that folder, which may include files like custom header files, or 
# custom libraries.

## DYNAMIC  LINKING ##

# If you wanna dynamically link the SFML Files, this is the way to do it. You will have to include the dll files right besides the exe file
# in your directory if you want them to work, and you will also have to bundle them with the package in the same way. 



# CXX := g++
# # Enter the name of the cpp file without the extention
# NAME := Dino_Game
# LDFLAGS := -L$(CURDIR)/lib/SFML

# # Always link these in the GWANS format. Graphics comes first. system last. 
# # The ones ending with -d are debug libraries, and the ones without that are the release libraries. 
# # When using an IDE to compile and link make sure to add them to the settings accordingly in the right order.
